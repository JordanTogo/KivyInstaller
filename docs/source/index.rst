`It ships Kivy right to you!`

Everyone can mess things up even with simple installation or update. In version
``1.8.0`` there was a batch file for making things easier for beginners or
regular users, but this file disappeared as the wheel came in. KivyInstaller is
inspired by this ``kivy.bat`` file from old portable package with multiple new
functions.

KivyInstaller provides:

- Installing Python (even for non-admin!)

- Installing & updating Kivy

- Switching between Kivy ``stable`` and ``master`` branch

- Updating itself

- Packaging Kivy application for Windows:

  - Test package
  - Full package

- Removing whole Kivy & Python installation

- And more...
